Our ship is a-sailing out over the Bar\
***'way down Rio***\
We're pointing her bow to the Southern Star\
***And we're bound for the Rio Grande***

***Then away, boys, away***\
***'way down Rio***\
***So fare thee well, my Bonny young girl***\
***We're bound for the Rio Grande***

Say was you ever down Rio Grande?\
It's there that the river flows down golden sand!

It's pack up your donkeys an' get underway,\
Them Judies we're leaving will draw half our pay

We've a bully good ship & a bully good crew,\
A bully good mate and a good skipper too

Cheer up, Mary Ellen, and don't look so glum,\
On white-stocking day you'll be drinking hot rum

So lift up your glasses and sing fare thee well\
There's a bonny young lass there to love you so well
