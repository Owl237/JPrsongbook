In the Black Ball line I served my time\
_To me way-aye-aye, hurrah-oh_\
And that's the line where you can shine\
_Hurrah for the Black Ball Line_

The Black Ball Ships are good and true\
_To me way-aye-aye, hurrah-oh_\
They are the ships for me and you\
_Hurrah for the Black Ball Line_

For once there was a Black Ball ship\
_To me way-aye-aye, hurrah-oh_\
That fourteen knots an hour could clip\
_Hurrah for the Black Ball Line_

They'll carry you along through frost and snow\
_To me way-aye-aye, hurrah-oh_\
And take you where the wind don't blow\
_Hurrah for the Black Ball Line_

You will surely find a rich gold mine\
_To me way-aye-aye, hurrah-oh_\
Just take a trip in the Black Ball Line\
_Hurrah for the Black Ball Line_

Just take a trip to Liverpool\
_To me way-aye-aye, hurrah-oh_\
To Liverpool, that Yankee school\
_Hurrah for the Black Ball Line_

The Yankee sailors you'll see there\
_To me way-aye-aye, hurrah-oh_\
With red-top boots and short-cut hair\
_Hurrah for the Black Ball Line_

At Liverpool docks we bid adieu\
_To me way-aye-aye, hurrah-oh_\
To friends and loves, but still sing true\
_Hurrah for the Black Ball Line_
