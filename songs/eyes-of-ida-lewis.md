description: A song about heroic American lighthouse-keeper Idawalley Zoradia Lewis (1842 – 1911).  Responding to criticism that it was un-ladylike for women to row boats, Lewis said that "None – but a donkey, would consider it 'un-feminine', to save lives."

I fell in love with Ida\
On the day I went to sea\
When she pulled us from the water\
My stupid friends and me

She said "I'm far too young to marry\
But I'll keep you in my sight"\
"And I'll bless the eyes of Ida\
Before I sleep at night"

>***Row Ida row, row me to your light\
Row, Ida row, keep me safe tonight***

As strong as any sailor\
As brave as any man\
"Why risk your life for fools?" she said\
"Because I can"

They travelled miles to praise her\
And she shyly took her bow\
She said "I never made a speech in my sweet short life\
And I ain't gonna make one now"

>***Row Ida row***

All alone in a lighthouse\
In a life no union bliss\
The only bells that ring for Ida\
Ring a sweet brave soul to rest

>***Row Ida row***

Eighteen souls she rescued\
Though she wasn't counting heads\
She gave sixty years so travellers\
Could sleep safe in their beds

When they called her strong she answered\
"It's the Lord that makes me rise"\
They see the lights that watch the harbour\
But I see Ida's eyes

>***Row Ida row***
