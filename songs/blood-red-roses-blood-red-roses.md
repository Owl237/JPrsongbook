Our boots and clothes is all in pawn,\
_Go down, you blood red roses, go down!_\
And its flamin' drafty 'round Cape Horn.

> _Go down, you blood red roses, go down!_\
> _Oh, you pinks and posies,_\
> _Go down, you blood red roses, go down!_

It's 'round that cape we all must go,\
_Go down, you blood red roses, go down!_\
Around all stiff through the frost and snow.

> _Go down, you blood red roses, go down!_

Our captain he has set us down,\
_Go down, you blood red roses, go down!_\
And he has sailed till Auckland town.\

> _Go down, you blood red roses, go down!_

Oh my old mother, she wrote to me,\
_Go down, you blood red roses, go down!_\
My dearest son, come home from sea.

> _Go down, you blood red roses, go down!_

It's growl you may, but go you must,\
_Go down, you blood red roses, go down!_\
If you growl too hard your head they'll bust.

> _Go down, you blood red roses, go down!_

Just one more pull and that will do,\
_Go down, you blood red roses, go down!_\
Just one more pull to see us through.

> _Go down, you blood red roses, go down!_
