Our boots and clothes is all in pawn,\
***Go down, you blood red roses, go down!***\
And its flamin' drafty 'round Cape Horn.\
***Go down, you blood red roses, go down!***

> ***Oh, you pinks and posies,***\
> ***Go down, you blood red roses, go down!***

It's 'round that cape we all must go,\
***Go down, you blood red roses, go down!***\
Around all stiff through the frost and snow.

> ***Oh, you pinks and posies...***\
> ***Go down, you blood red roses, go down!***

Our captain he has set us down,\
***Go down, you blood red roses, go down!***\
And he has sailed till Auckland town.\
***Go down, you blood red roses, go down!***

> ***Oh, you pinks and posies...***

Oh my old mother, she wrote to me,\
***Go down, you blood red roses, go down!***\
My dearest son, come home from sea.\
***Go down, you blood red roses, go down!***

> ***Oh, you pinks and posies...***

It's growl you may, but go you must,\
***Go down, you blood red roses, go down!***\
If you growl too hard your head they'll bust.\
***Go down, you blood red roses, go down!***

> ***Oh, you pinks and posies...***

Just one more pull and that will do,\
***Go down, you blood red roses, go down!***\
Just one more pull to see us through.\
***Go down, you blood red roses, go down!***

> ***Oh, you pinks and posies...***
