description: >-
  This shanty tells the common story of being pressed. Between 1664 and 1814,
  impressment was used to fill the crews of British navy ships. Any man between
  18 and 55 with sailing ability could be pressed into service by the Navy
  Impressment Service, known as 'The Press Gang'. The punishment for refusing
  was hanging. Having attempted to plead that they are non-sailors, the captain
  whips Billy O'Shea up the rigging, where his lack of topsman ability soon
  leads to his early demise. The cat referred to is the cat o' nine tails.

We all got drunk in Dublin city\
_Fall down me Billy_\
We all got drunk, sure more's the pity\
_Fall down Billy O'Shea_

> _Fall down, fall down, fall down me Billy_\
> _We're bound away for Americay_\
> _Fall down Billy O'Shea_

We lay ourselves down on Sir Rogerson's Quay\
_Fall down me Billy_\
And when we woke we were out to sea\
_Fall down Billy O'Shea_

> _Fall down, fall down, fall down me Billy_

We are not sailors captain dear\
_Fall down me Billy_\
We come from the land and we won't work here\
_Fall down Billy O'Shea_

> _Fall down, fall down, fall down me Billy_

Says the captain, "I've a cure for that"\
_Fall down me Billy_\
"And here for a start is a dose of the cat"\
_Fall down Billy O'Shea_

> _Fall down, fall down, fall down me Billy_

Well sent him up to the top-mast yard\
_Fall down me Billy_\
And when he hit the deck, well he took it hard\
_Fall down Billy O'Shea_

> _Fall down, fall down, fall down me Billy_

So we wrapped him in the Captain's sail\
_Fall down me Billy_\
And lowered him gently o'er the rail\
_Fall down Billy O'Shea_

> _Fall down, fall down, fall down me Billy_

Over the side and down he goes\
_Fall down me Billy_\
Down to Davy Jones with a stitch through his nose\
_Fall down Billy O'Shea_

> _Fall down, fall down, fall down me Billy_

Oh and as he went I heard him say\
_Fall down me Billy_\
I thought we were bound for Americay\
_Fall down Billy O'Shea_

> _Fall down, fall down, fall down me Billy_
