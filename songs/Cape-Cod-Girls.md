  This was likely used as a long haul or halyard shanty. The named town could be substituted for the name of another
  fishing town, should the sailors wish the song's jokes to be at someone else's
  expense.

Cape Cod girls ain't got no combs\
_Haul away, haul away_\
They comb their hair with codfish bones\
_And we're bound away for Australia_

> _So heave away, my bully, bully boys_\
> _Haul away, haul away_\
> _Heave away, why don't you make some noise_\
> _And we're bound away for Australia_

Cape Cod kids ain't got no sleds\
_Haul away, haul away_\
They slide down the hills on codfish heads\
_And we're bound away for Australia_

> _So heave away, my bully, bully boys_

Cape Cod men ain't got no ale\
_Haul away, haul away_\
They fill their glasses with codfish tails\
_And we're bound away for Australia_

> _So heave away, my bully, bully boys_

Cape Cod folk ain't got no ills\
_Haul away, haul away_\
Cape Cod doctors give 'em codfish pills\
_And we're bound away for Australia_

> _So heave away, my bully, bully boys_

Cape Cod mothers don't bake no pies\
_Haul away, haul away_\
They feed their kids on codfish eyes\
_And we're bound away for Australia_

> _So heave away, my bully, bully boys_

Cape Cod cats ain't got no tails\
_Haul away, haul away_\
They got blown off by the northeast gales
_And we're bound away for Australia_
