I heard the R2D2 say\
***Ben Kenobi, Nobi Too-Rye-Ay***\
Millenium Falcon's on its way\
***Ben Kenobi, Nobi Too-Rye-Ay***

> ***Too-Rye-Ay, Oh, Too-Rye-Ay***\
> ***Ben Kenobi, Nobi Too-Rye-Ay***

Who taught Luke about the Force?\
***Ben Kenobi, Nobi Too-Rye-Ay***\
Who's the Fountain, who's the Source?\
***Ben Kenobi, Nobi Too-Rye-Ay***

> ***(Chorus)***

Who does Alec Guinness play?\
Who's not in The Darling Buds Of May?

> ***(Chorus)***

Who stands next to Harrison Ford?\
Carrying a bloody great big sword?

> ***(Chorus)***

What comes after Jedi Day?\
Jedi Night, so the old men say

> ***(Chorus x 2)***
