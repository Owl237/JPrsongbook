I heard the R2D2 say\
_Ben Kenobi, Nobi Too-Rye-Ay_\
Millenium Falcon's on its way\
_Ben Kenobi, Nobi Too-Rye-Ay_

> _Too-Rye-Ay, Oh, Too-Rye-Ay_\
> _Ben Kenobi, Nobi Too-Rye-Ay_

Who taught Luke about the Force?\
_Ben Kenobi, Nobi Too-Rye-Ay_\
Who's the Fountain, who's the Source?\
_Ben Kenobi, Nobi Too-Rye-Ay_

> _(Chorus)_

Who does Alec Guinness play?\
Who's not in The Darling Buds Of May?

> _(Chorus)_

Who stands next to Harrison Ford?\
Carrying a bloody great big sword?

> _(Chorus)_

What comes after Jedi Day?\
Jedi Night, so the old men say

> _(Chorus x 2)_
