description: >-
  The general consensus is that 'bully' means 'drunk' and 'spliced' means
  'married'. We've added some new verses to change the relationship dynamic from
  dilly-dallying, and give Sally more of an active role... which she's used to
  initiate a pre-voyage romp.

> _So help me Bob, I'm bully in the alley_\
> _Way, hey, bully in the alley_\
> _So help me Bob, I'm bully in the alley_\
> _Bully down in Shinbone Al_

Sally is the girl that I love dearly\
_Way, hey, bully in the alley_\
Sally is the girl that I spliced nearly\
_Bully down in Shinbone Al_

> _So help me Bob, I'm bully in the alley_

I went to tell my Sally dear\
_Way, hey, bully in the alley_\
I hoped that she might shed a tear\
_Bully down in Shinbone Al_

> _So help me Bob, I'm bully in the alley_

Sweet Sally only shook her head\
_Way, hey, bully in the alley_\
She took my hand, took me to bed\
_Bully down in Shinbone Al_

> _So help me Bob, I'm bully in the alley_

We tossed and tumbled all night long-o\
_Way, hey, bully in the alley_\
In the morning the cock did crow-o\
_Bully down in Shinbone Al_

> _So help me Bob, I'm bully in the alley_

I left my Sal, went a-sailing\
_Way, hey, bully in the alley_\
Signed on a big ship, went a-whaling\
_Bully down in Shinbone Al_

> _So help me Bob, I'm bully in the alley_

If ever I get back, she says we'll marry\
_Way, hey, bully in the alley_\
Have six kids and live in Shinbone Alley\
_Bully down in Shinbone Al_

> _So help me Bob, I'm bully in the alley_
