description: >-
  Screwing cotton was one of the hardest tasks aboard ship: using jackscrews to
  compress and force bales of cotton into the hold until they were packed solid.
  There's no consensus on what 'Marengo' means.

Lift him up and carry him along\
_Fire Marengo, fire away!_\
Stow him down where he belongs\
_Fire Marengo, fire away!_

Ease him in and let him lay\
_Fire Marengo, fire away!_\
We'll screw him down and there he'll stay\
_Fire Marengo, fire away!_

Stow him down in the hold below\
_Fire Marengo, fire away!_\
Screw him down and then we'll go\
_Fire Marengo, fire away!_

When I get back to London town\
_Fire Marengo, fire away!_\
I'll pass my line to pretty Sally Brown\
_Fire Marengo, fire away!_

Screw the cotton, screw him down\
_Fire Marengo, fire away!_\
Bound away from Hilo Town\
_Fire Marengo, fire away!_

Thought I heard the old man say\
_Fire Marengo, fire away!_\
That's one last turn and then belay\
_Fire Marengo, fire away!_
