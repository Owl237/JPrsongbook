In South Australia I was born

> (To me) heave away, haul away

In South Australia round Cape Horn

> We're bound for South Australia

Haul away you rolling Kings

> (To me) heave away, haul away

Haul away, you'll hear me sing

> We're bound for South Australia

As I walked out one morning fair

'Twas there I met miss Nancy Blair

She shook me up and I shook her down

We shook around and round the town

We run all night and we run all day

We ran until I sailed away

There ain't but one thing grieves me mind

To leave Miss Nancy Blair behind

As we wallop 'round Cape Horn

You'll wish to god you'd never been born

In South Australia my native land

Full of rocks and thieves and fleas and sand

I wish I was on Australia's strand

With a bottle of whiskey in my hand
