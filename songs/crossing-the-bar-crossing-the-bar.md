Sunset and evening star,\
And one clear call for me!\
And may there be no moaning of the bar\
When I put out to sea.

>_When I put out to sea,_\
>_When I put out to sea._\
>_And may there be no moaning of the bar_\
>_When I put out to sea._

But such a tide as moving seems asleep,\
Too full for sound and foam,\
When that which drew from out the boundless deep\
Turns again home.

>_Turns again home,_\
>_Turns again home,_\
>_When that which drew from out the boundless deep_\
>_Turns again home._

Twilight and evening bell,\
And after that the dark!\
And may there be no sadness of farewell\
When I embark.

>_When I embark,_\
>_When I embark,_\
>_And may there be no sadness of farewell_\
>_When I embark._

For though from out our bourne of time and place\
The flood may bear me far,\
I hope to see my Pilot face to face\
When I have crossed the bar.

>_When I have crossed the bar,_\
>_When I have crossed the bar,_\
>_I hope to see my Pilot face to face_\
>_When I have crossed the bar._
