description: >-
  We've got rid of the verses criticising the characteristics of various women!
  An ironic singing of verse 3 can be enhanced with another verse in dialogue.
  We've had a stab here with a new verse where our sailor discovers that maybe
  he doesn't want to kiss the girls after all...

Louis was the king of France\
Before the revolut-i-on

***Away, haul away, we'll haul away Joe***

But then he got his head chopped off\
Which spoiled his constitut-i-on

***Away, haul away, we'll haul away Joe***

> ***(To me) way, haul away***\
> ***(To me) way, haul away***\
> ***We'll haul away together***\
> ***(To me) way, haul away***\
> ***We'll haul away together***\
> ***Away, haul away, we'll haul away Joe***\
> ***(To me) way, haul away***\
> ***We'll haul for better weather***\
> ***Away, haul away, we'll haul away Joe***

Saint Patrick was a gentleman\
He came from decent people\
He built a church in Dublin Town\
And on it put a steeple

Now when I was a little boy\
And so me mother told me\
That if I didn't kiss the girls\
Me lips would all grow mouldy

\*\*\*\*Well now I only kiss the boys\
It's them I like to hold me\
I can't say I miss the girls\
And me lips did not go mouldy\*\**

The cook is in the galley boys\
Making duff so handy\
The captain's in his cabin lads\
Drinking wine and brandy

Way haul away\
We'll haul away the bowline\
Way, haul away\
The packet is a-rollin'
