Once there was a barge lad

>_Way up atop the mast_

Shouting to the skipper "we've made it home at last"

Well I was that barge lad

>_Way up atop the mast_

But now I'm the skipper and that young nipper had better be holding fast

>_Oh, we're loaded down with bales so high_\
>_You've got to lean backwards if you want to see the sky_\
>_Oh, the Thames may forgive us, but the old never will_\
>_So eyes front and away we sail_

Oh, you've got to be able

>_Way up atop the mast_

Your legs better be nimble and your head better think fast

Well I was that able

>_Way up atop the mast_

But now I'm the skipper and that young nipper is hardy enough to last

>_Oh, we're loaded down with bales so high_\
>_You've got to lean backwards if you want to see the sky_\
>_Oh, the Thames may forgive us, but the old never will_\
>_So eyes front, keep your head, and away we sail_

Oh, you've eyes like an eagle

>_Way up atop the mast_

Spotting all the obstacles that come across your path

Well, I was that eagle

>_Way up atop the mast_

But now I'm the skipper and that young nipper will keep us from taking a bath

>_Oh, we're loaded down with bales so high_\
>_You've got to lean backwards if you want to see the sky_\
>_Oh, the Thames may forgive us, but the old never will_\
>_So eyes front, keep your head, clear your throat, and away we sail_

Oh, you've got to remember

>_Way up atop the mast_

Knowing all the river routes that you never learn from the charts

Well, I do remember

>_Way up atop the mast_

But now I'm the skipper and that young nipper is taking the rivers to heart

>_Oh, we're loaded down with bales so high_\
>_You've got to lean backwards if you want to see the sky_\
>_Oh, the Thames may forgive us, but the old never will_\
>_So eyes front, keep your head, clear your throat,_\
>_Know your way, fill your pipe,_\
>_Grab on tight, look for the light and away we sail_
