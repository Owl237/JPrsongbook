The Navy would never have a lass at sea\
***Away Santianna***\
So I went in search of piracy\
***All along the coast of Mexico***

> ***So heave her up and away we'll go***\
> ***Heave away Santianna***\
> ***Heave her up and away we'll go***\
> ***All along the coast of Mexico***

And now we sail the Southern Seas\
***Away Santianna***\
And we'll have those lads down on their knees\
***All along the coast of Mexico***

In Mexico I want to be\
***Away Santianna***\
With a cask of rum on a drinkin' spree\
***All along the coast of Mexico***

When I was a young lass in my prime\
***Away Santianna***\
I had them sailor lads two at a time\
***All along the coast of Mexico***

But I'd never leave the sea to settle down\
***Away Santianna***\
When I can have a man in every town\
***All along the coast of Mexico***

The times is hard and the riches low\
***Away Santianna***\
But we pirates must "row and yo‚Äù\
***All along the coast of Mexico***
