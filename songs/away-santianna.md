The Navy would never have a lass at sea\
_Away Santianna_\
So I went in search of piracy\
_All Along the coast of Mexico_

>So heave her up and away we'll go\
>_Heave away Santianna_\
>To Mexico where the warm winds blow\
>_All Along the coast of Mexico_

And now we sail the Southern Seas\
_Away Santianna_\
And we'll have those lads down on their knees\
_All Along the coast of Mexico_

In Mexico I want to be\
_Away Santianna_\
With a cask of rum on a drinkin' spree\
_All Along the coast of Mexico_

When I was a young lass in my prime\
_Away Santianna_\
I had them Irish lads two at a time\
_All Along the coast of Mexico_

But I'd never leave the sea to settle down\
_Away Santianna_\
When I can have a man in every town\
_All Along the coast of Mexico_

The times is hard and the riches low\
_Away Santianna_\
But we pirates must "row and yo‚Äù\
_All Along the coast of Mexico_
