We looked for the Sloop John A;\
We looked for it all day;\
Round Nassau Town we did roam,\
A man on the pier,\
Said it wasn't here;\
We didn't find it,\
And then we went home.

>***Where can the John A be?\
Maybe the A's at sea;\
We had a good look round\
Then we went home\
Then we went home\
We had to go home\
We didn't find it\
And then we went home.***

The first mate was not there,\
Maybe he was elsewhere;\
Maybe he was on board the Sloop John A;
Wherever he was,\
We didn't meet him because\
We didn't find it\
And then we went home.

>***Where can the John A be? ...***

The day was a non-event,\
It seemed the A had went;\
Then they told us that there's another called B.\
B was OK;\
I had my heart set on A;\
We didn't find it,\
And then we went home.

>***Where can the John A be? ...***
