I wish I was a cabin boy, aboard a Man O\'War\
***Sam\'s gone away, aboard a Man O\'War***

I wish I was a cabin boy, aboard a Man O\'War\
***Sam\'s gone away, aboard a Man O\'War***

> ***Pretty work, brave boys***\
> ***Pretty work, I say***\
> ***Sam\'s gone away, aboard a Man O\'War***

I wish I was the Bosun aboard a Man O\'War\
***Sam\'s gone away, aboard a Man O\'War***

I wish I was the Midshipman aboard a Man O\'War\
***Sam\'s gone away, aboard a Man O\'War***

I wish I was the Captain, aboard a Man O\'War\
***Sam\'s gone away, aboard a Man O\'War***

I wish I was the Admiral aboard a Man O\'War\
***Sam\'s gone away, aboard a Man O\'War***

I wish I was a sailor lass aboard a Man O\'War\
***Sam\'s gone away, aboard a Man O\'War***
