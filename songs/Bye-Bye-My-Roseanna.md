The boats are sailing round the bay,\
_Bye-bye my Roseanna._\
All loaded down with fishermen,\
_I won't be home tomorrow._

> _Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye_\
> _Bye-bye, my Roseanna_\
> _Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye_\
> _I won't be home tomorrow_

A dollar a day is a fisherman's pay\
_Bye-bye my Roseanna._\
It's easy come, easy go away\
_I won't be home tomorrow._

> _Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye_

We're leaving port at break of day\
_Bye-bye my Roseanna._\
We're sailing out across the bay\
_I won't be home tomorrow._

> _Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye_

Around the horn we must go\
_Bye-bye my Roseanna._\
The gales are strong and the winds do blow\
_I won't be home tomorrow._

> _Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye_

Roseanne, my Roseanne\
_Bye-bye my Roseanna._\
I'm going away but not to stay\
_I won't be home tomorrow._

> _Bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye-bye_
