  This modern shanty by [Les Sullivan](https://howlingtoad.webs.com/) explores
  the fate of various ships which fought in the Battle of Jutland in 1916, the
  largest fleet action of the First World War, which led to huge loss of life on
  both the British and German sides. Queen Mary, Invincible, and Black Prince
  were three of the British battleships which were lost. This song can be found
  on the album [Echoes of
  Mingulay](https://howlingtoad.webs.com/echoes-of-mingulay), and Les has kindly
  given us permission to reproduce the lyrics here.

Where are you goin' my Billy-O?\
Where are you goin' my Billy-O?\
I'm joining a ship in Scapa Flow,\
That's where I'm going my Nancy

I'm joining "Queen Mary" Nancy-O\
Joining "Queen Mary" Nancy-O\
She's bristling with guns and ready to go\
To sail to glory with Jellicoe

But where is "Queen Mary"? Gone Now!\
And where is the glory? Gone Now!\
And six thousand sailors, Gone Now!\
They have gone to the bottom at Jutland.

Where are you goin' my Rodney-O?\
Where are you goin' my Rodney-O?\
I'm joining a ship in Scapa Flow\
That's where I'm going my Nancy

I'm joining "Invincible" Nancy-O\
Joining "Invincible" Nancy-O\
She's bristling with guns and ready to go\
To sail to glory with Jellicoe

But where is "Invincible"? Gone Now!\
And where is the glory? Gone Now!\
And six thousand sailors, Gone Now!\
They have gone to the bottom at Jutland.

Where are you goin' my Johnny-O?\
Where are you goin' my Johnny-O?\
I'm joining a ship in Scapa Flow\
That's where I'm going my Nancy

I'm joining the "Black Prince" Nancy-O\
Joining the "Black Prince" Nancy-O\
She's bristling with guns and ready to go\
To sail to glory with Jellicoe

But where is the "Black Prince"? Gone Now!\
And where is the glory? Gone Now!\
And six thousand sailors, Gone Now!\
They have gone to the bottom at Jutland.
