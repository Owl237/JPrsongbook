To Cuba's coast we're bound me boys\
***Way, me boys, for Cuba***\
To Cuba's coast boys, don't you make a noise\
***Running down to Cuba.***

> ***Way, me boys, for Cuba***\
> ***Running down to Cuba***

The Captain he will trim the sails\
***Way, me boys, for Cuba***\
Flinging the water out over the rails\
***Running down to Cuba.***

***Way, me boys, for Cuba***\
***Running down to Cuba***

Oh my lord! how the wind do blow
Running South from the ice and snow

Oh, I've got a gal who's nine feet tall
She sleeps in the kitchen with her feet in the hall

Give me a gal who can dance Fandango
I'll woo her with melon, papaya and mango

To Cuba's coast we are bound, away
To Cuba's coast at the breaking of the day
