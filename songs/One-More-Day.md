Have you heard the news, my Johnny\
***One more day!***\
We're homeward bound tomorrow\
***Only one more day!***

Don't you hear the old man growlin'\
Don't you hear the mate a howlin'

Don't you hear the old man callin'\
Don't you hear the pilot bawlin'

Only one more day a-howlin'\
Can't you hear the gals a-callin'

Only one more day a-rollin'\
Can't you hear the gulls a-callin'

Only one more day a-furlin'\
Only one more day a-cursin'

Heave and sight the anchor, Johnny\
For we're close 'board the port, Johnny

Put on your long-tail blue, Johnny\
For your payday's nearly due.

We're homeward bound today, Johnny\
We'll leave her without sorrow, Johnny

Pack your bags today, my Johnny\
O, an' leave her where she lies, Johnny

No more gales or heavy weather\
Only one more day together

Only one more day, my Johnny,\
O, rock and roll me over.
