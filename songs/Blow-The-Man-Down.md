description: >-
  The Black Ball Line was the name of two fleets of transatlantic packet ships,
  one based in Liverpool and the other in New York. 'Kicking Jack Williams' was
  a captain on the American side. Infamous for tough discipline on board, he was
  also famed for record-breaking runs.

Come all you young fellows that follow the sea,\
_To me way, hey, blow the man down_\
Now please pay attention and listen to me\
_Give me some time to blow the man down_

>_Blow the man down to me, blow the man down_,\
>_To me way, hey, blow the man down_\
>_Blow him right back to Liverpool town,_\
>_Give me some time to blow the man down_

I'm a deep water sailor just come from Hong Kong,\
_To me way, hey, blow the man down_\
You give me some whiskey I'll sing you a song\
_Give me some time to blow the man down_

>_Blow the man down to me, blow the man down_

'Twas on a black baller I first served my time,\
_To me way, hey, blow the man down_\
On a trim black ball liner I wasted me prime\
_Give me some time to blow the man down_

>_Blow the man down to me, blow the man down_

When a trim black ball liner's preparing for sea,\
_To me way, hey, blow the man down_\
You'll split your sides laughing, such sights you would see\
_Give me some time to blow the man down_

>_Blow the man down to me, blow the man down_

Now when the big liner, she's clear of the land,\
_To me way, hey, blow the man down_\
Our bosun he roars out the word of command\
_Give me some time to blow the man down_

>_Blow the man down to me, blow the man down_

"Come quickly, lay aft to the break of the poop,\
_To me way, hey, blow the man down_\
Or I'll help you along with the toe of my boot"\
_Give me some time to blow the man down_

>_Blow the man down to me, blow the man down_

Pay attention to orders now, you one and all,\
_To me way, hey, blow the man down_\
For see high above, there flies the Black Ball\
_Give me some time to blow the man down_

>_Blow the man down to me, blow the man down_

'Tis larboard and starboard on deck you will sprawl,\
_To me way, hey, blow the man down_\
For Kicking Jack Williams commands the Black Ball\
_Give me some time to blow the man down_

>_Blow the man down to me, blow the man down_
